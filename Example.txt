Our computers are fast and have vast amounts of memory and \
could be very helpful to us if we only knew the language to\
speak to explain to the computer what we would like it to \
do 3665 next. 7936  9772 If we knew this language, we could tell the \
 computer to do tasks on our behalf that were repetitive.  \
Interestingly, the kinds of things computers can do best\
are often the kinds of things that we humans find boring\
and mind-numbing.\
\
For example, look at the first three paragraphs of this\
chapter and tell me the most commonly used word and how\
many times the word is used.  While you were able to read\
and understand the words in a few seconds, counting them\
is almost painful because it is not the kind of problem \
that human minds are designed to solve.  For a computer\
the opposite is true, reading and understanding text \
from a piece of paper is hard for a computer to do \
but counting the words and telling you how many times\
the most used word was used is very easy for the\
computer:\
7114 \
Our personal information analysis assistant quickly \
told us that the word to was used sixteen times in the\
first three paragraphs of this chapter.}
